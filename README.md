MSP Course & Lab Selector / Planner

This repository contains a web-based MSP course and lab planner that lets students select courses and automatically see compatible labs (that do not overlap in day/time). 
It is a lightweight, interactive version of the original Excel course/lab selector and has evolved into a more advanced single-page academic planning tool.

🧩 Features
Select Courses & Labs: Choose one or two courses and automatically see compatible labs in real-time.
Interactive Course Catalogue: Search and filter through the full MSP course offering using specialized “Filter Chips” (e.g., by Period, Discipline, or Level).
Academic Planning: Drag-and-drop or select courses to build a multi-year academic plan.
Transcript Integration: Upload official transcripts (PDF) to automatically mark completed courses using pdf.js.
Data Visualization: Visualize curriculum balance across different scientific disciplines.
Persistent Storage: Save your plan locally in the browser to continue later without losing progress.
Offline-first: Fully functional offline once the page and assets are loaded.
